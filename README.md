Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock

This program is a website that allows the user to play Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock. The user can play against a computer, which utilizes an API to generate moves, or against a local person. The user can also choose between Best of One, Best of Three, and Best of Seven rounds.

1/16/24: Built out, by all intents and purposes, all of the JS needed for the website. Adjustments in the HTML and CSS files might require the JS file to be tweaked, but the website is currently fully functional. 1/17/24: Worked on the HTML and CSS for the website. While still lacking substantial styling, the HTML framework is mostly there and the CSS has the elements in generally the location they should be in.
