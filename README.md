Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock

This program is a website that allows the user to play Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock. The user can play against a computer, which utilizes an API to generate moves, or against a local person. The user can also choose between Best of One, Best of Three, and Best of Seven rounds.

1/16/24: Built out, by all intents and purposes, all of the JS needed for the website. Adjustments in the HTML and CSS files might require the JS file to be tweaked, but the website is currently fully functional. 1/17/24: Worked on the HTML and CSS for the website. While still lacking substantial styling, the HTML framework is mostly there and the CSS has the elements in generally the location they should be in. 1/18/24: Continued to work on styling for the website. Added a background, and currently working on adding custom buttons. I want to get all custom images in before working on positioning, which should be the last step. 1/19/24: Completed the styling of the website by adding all images and adjusting all positioning. The website is done. Gonna work on a custom API, because why not? 1/19/24: Added extra stuff. Created a rigged game button in which the user will lose, and added a local API to replace the RPSLS API call. */**/24: I removed the local API as it was local hosted, not Azure hosted.

Code looks good and i was suprised to see that you used services to create your own api which was a nice addition, also the rigged gamemode was pretty entertaining and the styling was very appealing.
One thing though, the single player didnt seem to work properly as when i clicked a icon, then submit it did not seem to do anything. But other than a few small bugfixes everything looks great.
